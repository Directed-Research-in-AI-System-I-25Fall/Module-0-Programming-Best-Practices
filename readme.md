## Learning Objectives
In this project, we will learn the basics of git, huggingface and continuous development.


## TODO
1. Please create a new folder called ``git_and_huggingface'' (shall it be the same repo for the big project)
2. Create a file called readme.md 
3. Commit the changes, and after that make sure to commit every single step
4. Install huggingface (maybe the transformer module)
5. Create a new branch called dev
6. Overload a function in the huggingface
8. Merge the branch to the main branch
9. Push the changes to the remote repository (github)
12. Delete the dev branch
13. Reverse the changes to the step 3 (so the repo only has a readme)
